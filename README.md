# GettingCleaningDataFinalProj
Materials for the Final Project in Data Science Unit 3: Getting and Cleaning Data
Includes required input files:
   1. X_train & X_test: experimental data
   2. y_train & y_test: numeric ID describing the activity
   3. subject_train & subject_test: numeric IDs describing individual participants
   4. features.txt: used to provide the column headers to the experimental data in X_train & X_test
   
Includes R code, run_analysis.R, that can be executed to produce the results
Includes TidyData.csv which is the incomplete tidy data set. I believe it satisfied items 1, 2 & 4 of the assignment.

The run_analysis.R creates a function run_analysis() that takes no arguments. As such, the working directory should contain the input files listed in 1 through 4 above.
